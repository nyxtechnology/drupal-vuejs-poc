# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# Change record https://www.drupal.org/node/2582945.
# As the UI of Drupal improves between minor versions, the markup and assets
# in the Claro theme will change. The Claro theme is not backwards compatible.
# If you wish to modify the output or assets of Claro you can:
# 1. Copy the whole of Claro and rename it as your own administration theme. You
# will need to manually manage your own updates if you want to stay up to
# date with Claro's bug fixes and feature support.
#
# 2. Sub-theme Claro. This is only recommended if you want to make minor tweaks
# and understand that Claro could break your modifications as it changes.
